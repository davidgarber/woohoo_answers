### Description

**Woohoo Answers**

This app allows users to post, edit, and delete questions and answers to those questions.

### Author(s)

Brent Bailey
### Setup

This app was written in `JavaScript`, `Ember.js` `HTML`, and `JQuery`.

Clone this repo with
```console
> git clone https://github.com/brondle/woohoo_answers.git
```

Start App:

Because the app uses AJAX to load templates, you cannot open index.html from the file:// protocol. Instead, you must start a web server to load your app. The easiest way to start a web server is to download Mongoose, copy it into your project directory, and open it up. Alternatively, on a Mac, you can run $ python -m SimpleHTTPServer from your project directly, and then in your browser, visit http://0.0.0.0:8000.
